You want to achieve the following:

API Setup:

A Flask-based API hosted on GCE Free Tier or any free platform.
Endpoints that allow you to authenticate via the broker and perform operations such as fetching LTP, buying shares, and retrieving stock data.
Authorization will be handled through the broker's authentication (via AppKey, userid, password, DOB, TOTP).
Integration with Google Sheets:

Use Google Sheets as the input for:
Share names.
Stop-loss values.
Buy signals.
Use Google Apps Script to:
Loop through the sheet data.
Call the API to retrieve LTP or trigger buy/sell actions.
Workaround for any AppScript header-related limitations.
Authentication:

Broker authentication will act as the authorization for accessing the API.
Once logged in, API calls will rely on the session (auth token) to perform broker operations.
Hosting:

You want to use GCE Free Tier or any other free solution for hosting the API.
Proposed Workflow
API Design:

Create endpoints for:
/api/login: Authenticate with the broker and initialize the session.
/api/ltp: Fetch the LTP for a given stock or list of stocks.
/api/buy: Trigger a buy action for a stock.
/api/upload: Handle bulk operations (if needed).
Broker's auth token will be stored temporarily in the backend for session management (one login per day).
Google Sheets + Apps Script:

Google Sheets will act as the front-end for input and data.
Write an Apps Script that:
Reads the rows of data (e.g., share name, stop loss, buy signal).
Calls the Flask API endpoints in a loop for each row.
Writes the returned LTP, status, or action back into Google Sheets.
Hosting:

Use Google Compute Engine (GCE) free tier.
Deploy the Flask API with gunicorn and nginx for production readiness.
Testing:

Use Postman or curl to verify API functionality.
Test Apps Script integration with the hosted API using the UrlFetchApp service.
Plan for Development
Phase 1: Flask API Development
Set up the Flask API.
Define the following endpoints:
/api/login:
Input: AppKey, userid, password, DOB, TOTP.
Output: Authentication success message with a broker session.
/api/ltp:
Input: Stock symbol/token.
Output: LTP and other relevant data.
/api/buy:
Input: Stock symbol/token, quantity, price, etc.
Output: Order placement status.
/api/upload (optional):
Input: Bulk data (e.g., Excel file).
Output: Processed stock data with actions or calculations.
Phase 2: Google Sheets Integration
Write an Apps Script to:
Loop through the sheet rows.
Send requests to the API for each row (e.g., fetch LTP, place a buy order).
Write the response (e.g., LTP, success/failure) back to the sheet.
Phase 3: Hosting
Set up a free-tier GCE instance.
Deploy the Flask API using gunicorn and nginx for production.
Use an HTTPS endpoint for secure communication between Apps Script and the API.
Phase 4: Testing
Verify API endpoints with Postman.
Test Apps Script calling the API and processing the responses.
Suggestions and Comments
For API Deployment
Google Compute Engine (GCE):
Free tier allows you to host a small f1-micro instance.
Ideal for a Python-based Flask app.
Alternative (Free Hosting):
Use PythonAnywhere or Railway.app for easier hosting if setting up GCE is too complex.
For Google Sheets Integration
Apps Script Headers Issue:
Apps Script doesn’t allow custom headers in UrlFetchApp. However, this can be avoided by:
Using query parameters or payloads instead of headers.
If headers are mandatory, use Authorization for tokens (if needed).
General Notes
Since the API will work with sensitive broker credentials, ensure:
HTTPS is enforced for secure communication.
Avoid logging sensitive data (e.g., AppKey, password) in your Flask app.
Keep broker sessions active for one day, as you plan to call the API daily.
Next Steps
Let me know if you’d like me to:

Begin converting your code into the Flask API.
Write the Apps Script for Google Sheets integration.
Help you set up the GCE Free Tier instance for hosting.


Plan for Flask Conversion
Setup Flask Application:

Initialize a basic Flask project.
Define the necessary routes (/api/login, /api/ltp, /api/buy).
Use Flask-RESTful or plain Flask for REST API design.
Extract Logic from Your Code:

Move the login, LTP fetching, and order logic from your provided code into functions or classes in the Flask app.
Create Endpoints:

/api/login: For authenticating with the broker.
/api/ltp: To fetch the LTP for given stock(s).
/api/buy: To place a buy order for a stock.
Error Handling:

Add proper error handling for cases like invalid credentials, network errors, etc.
Structure the Flask App:

Follow a clean and modular project structure:
bash
Copy code
