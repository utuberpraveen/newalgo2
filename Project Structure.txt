I need a Python-based Flask application that serves as a trading bot platform with the following functionalities:

User Registration and Authentication:
Set up user registration and login functionality using Flask with secure password hashing (e.g., using werkzeug.security).
Use SQLite as the database (with a structure for storing user details) initially, with potential for migration to MySQL.
Excel File Upload and Parsing:
Each user should be able to upload an Excel file containing their trading instructions.
Use pandas to parse the Excel file, which will include columns for Stock Symbol, Target Buy Price, Target Sell Price, Quantity, and Stop-Loss Price.
Store the parsed data in a user-specific database table.
Bot Control:
Create a Start button on the user dashboard to initiate the trading bot.
Once started, the bot should fetch real-time stock prices from an API (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or an Indian stock market API).
Include a Stop button to allow users to pause or stop the bot at any time.
Real-Time Price Monitoring and Trade Execution:
For each stock in the uploaded Excel file, monitor the live price data to check:
If the current price matches or falls below the Target Buy Price to trigger a buy order.
If the current price reaches or exceeds the Target Sell Price to trigger a sell order.
If the current price reaches the Stop-Loss Price for an immediate sell.
Use mock buy/sell functions for testing purposes, with real trading APIs to be integrated later.
Order Logging and Notifications:
Log all buy/sell transactions with details like timestamp, executed price, quantity, and order status in a user-specific log table.
Send email, WhatsApp, or Telegram notifications to the user upon trade executions or critical events, like reaching the stop-loss price.
User Dashboard:
Provide a real-time dashboard showing the bot’s status, recent trades, current stock prices, and an optional live P&L calculation.
Error Handling and Security:
Implement error handling for network/API issues, invalid data inputs, and unauthorized access.
Ensure each user’s data and bot session is isolated from others.
Securely store and manage all credentials, and encrypt sensitive information.




Project Overview
This application is a Flask-based stock trading platform where multiple users can:

Authenticate securely, ideally using Google OAuth.
Manage a trading bot that performs trading operations (buy/sell) based on pre-defined criteria.
Upload and store stock data for the bot to utilize.
View a dashboard displaying the bot's activity, trading status, and account details.
Receive notifications regarding trading activity through potential integrations (WhatsApp, Telegram).
Key Requirements and Workflow
1. User Authentication
Goal: Allow multiple users to log in via Google OAuth.
Workflow:
When a user navigates to http://127.0.0.1:5000/, they should be automatically redirected to the login page if not authenticated.
On successful login, their credentials should be verified through Google OAuth, and a user entry should be stored in the database if they are logging in for the first time.
After logging in, they are redirected to the dashboard, where they can manage their bot.
2. User Management and Storage
Goal: Maintain a record of users who have logged into the system.
Database Structure:
A User table to store each user’s email, authentication status, and unique identifier.
The User model should be accessible for managing user sessions and tracking activity.
3. Bot Management and Configuration
Goal: Allow users to upload a stock list and configure bot settings (e.g., buy/sell criteria, stop-loss).
Workflow:
Users can upload a spreadsheet containing stock symbols, target prices, quantities, and stop-loss information.
This data is parsed and stored in a StockData table linked to each user.
Users can start and stop their bots, which will run during specific market hours.
4. Stock Data Management
Goal: Allow users to provide stock data for the bot to use.
Workflow:
A utility function (excel_parser.py) reads the uploaded stock list and stores the information in the database.
Stock data includes details like stock symbols, buy/sell prices, and quantities.
5. Dashboard Display and Real-Time Updates
Goal: Display an interactive dashboard that shows:
Bot status (online/offline).
Last trade and market price updates.
Logs of all buy/sell operations.
Workflow:
Upon successful login, users are redirected to the dashboard.
The dashboard page (dashboard.html) retrieves data from the backend, such as the bot’s current status, recent trades, and any live price updates.
6. Notifications and Alerts
Goal: Send real-time notifications about trading actions.
Future Scope: Consider integrating WhatsApp or Telegram for push notifications about trade actions or account events.
Key File Structure (as you provided earlier)
Each file and module in the structure aligns with these requirements, ensuring separation of concerns:

app/: Main application directory, with sub-modules for each major functionality (authentication, bot management, notifications).
app/auth/routes.py: Handles user authentication routes (login, logout).
app/views/dashboard.py: Contains the dashboard route, rendering a page with user and bot information.
app/utils/excel_parser.py: Parses uploaded Excel files for stock data.
Workflow Summary
Access the Application: Visiting http://127.0.0.1:5000/ redirects to the login page if unauthenticated.
Authentication: Users log in via Google, creating or retrieving their profile in the database.
Bot Configuration: After login, users navigate to the dashboard, upload stock lists, and configure bot settings.
Dashboard Monitoring: Users view the bot's real-time activities and trading status on the dashboard.
Notifications: (Future scope) Users receive alerts for trade actions on chosen messaging platforms.
